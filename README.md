# Mathematics-with-GUI-and-Voice
In this project I have used a GUI library of python which is "Tkinter" to make visualization of mathematical formulas besides that I have implemented voice based solutions for the same using Google's Text to Speech API.
This Project has used following library files:-
1.Tkinter(For GUI)
2.speech_recognition(For recognizing or accepting the input in the form of audio from user)
3.pyttsx3(pyttsx3 stands for python text-to-speech V-3. This library use GOOGLE API to convert speech to text.)

Note:- This is the not the final build still there can be bugs in this projects. You can use this project as a refernce that how to bring all above tools at 1 place using python.
